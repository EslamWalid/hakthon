For people who are blind or visually impaired the white cane and guide dog have a long history of use.

                    The goal of our Cognitive Aids in Medicine research group is to explore how to best design and measure the impact of the use of cognitive aids in medicine. We are focusing our initial efforts on high-stakes medical interventions that we believe would most likely benefit from aiding cognition: critical events in medicine.

                    Computer software and hardware have done so much for those with disabilities. There are numerous technological devices and programs readily available to help with those with physical, intellectual, speech, hearing, and vision impairments. These include voice recognition programs, screen readers, and screen enlargement applications to help people with mobility and sensory impairments use computers and mobile devices. Closed captioning technology also allows people with hearing problems to watch movies, television programs, and other digital media.
